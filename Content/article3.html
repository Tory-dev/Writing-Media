      <p>On Friday morning it was just a normal day at Green Valley High School known for its tough-to-beat sports teams and the school where the famous Issac Alsop graduated from. However, that morning was turned into chaos when a fight broke out in the classroom with Mr.Katz. </p>

      <p>The fight started when one young man got out of his seat and provokes another young man. They argue with each other, escalate into threats, and started to shove each other eyewitnesses say. This is when Mr.Katz, a math teacher steps in to break up the confrontation.</p>

      <p>One of the students back off but another one wanted to continue so Mr.Katz puts his arm to give the students some space. This is where the first student hits the teacher in the face knocking off his glasses. Mr.Katz retaliates with a hit to the nose which leads to the student having his nose broken. Immediately the school nurse was called which led to the ambulance being called.</p>

      <p>Some believe that Mr.Katz should be fired for hitting a student while others believe he shouldnâ€™t because it was an act of self-defense. The school board is still deciding on whether Mr.Katz should receive a punishment or not.</p>
