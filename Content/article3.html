      <p>On Friday morning it was just a normal day at Green Valley High School known for its tough-to-beat sports teams and the school where the famous actor Issac Alsop graduated from. However, that morning was turned into chaos when a fight broke out in the classroom with Mr.Katz.  </p>

      <p>The chaos started when one young man got out of his seat and provokes another young man. They argue with each other, escalate into threats, and started to shove each other eyewitnesses say. This is when Mr.Katz, a math teacher steps in to break up the confrontation.</p>

      <p>One of the students back off but another one wanted to continue so Mr.Katz puts his arm to give the students some space. This is where the first student hits the teacher in the face knocking off his glasses. Mr.Katz retaliates with a hit to the nose which leads to the student having his nose broken. Immediately the school nurse was called which led to the ambulance being called.</p>

      <p>“He isn’t the type of man to hit someone without a reason to do it.” says another faculty member.</p>

      <p>“Mr.Katz is a chill dude and I've never seen him get angry,” says another student.</p>

      <p>Some believe that Mr.Katz should be fired for hitting a student while others believe he shouldn’t because it was an act of self-defense. The school board is still deciding on whether Mr.Katz should receive a punishment or not. Their final decision will be publicly announced next week, and we will keep you updated once the times come.</p>
