      <p>Issac Alsop is a 22-year-old actor that is adored by many. Once a small-time actor who only land minor roles but got his big break with a show called “Blue Secrets” as Tony the lead character. Now the actor is landing big roles one after another and even has a podcast to advise aspiring actors. People around him say he is a nice guy who always greets people around him and is a joy to be around.  </p>

      <p>However, Issac Alsop did something that is quite a shocker to everyone. On Friday, old messages from 2015 of Alsop saying bad stuff. Like “I hope Zack loses his spot in the play so I can take his spot.” and “I hope Zack gets sick so I can get the lead spot in the play.” Alsop was an understudy who wanted the lead role in his school play so much that he wished sickness on his classmate.</p>

      <p>Now Alsop apologizes for the messages saying, “I was a stupid kid who was too ambitious that I wish my classmate didn’t have the lead role. I am truly sorry.” The public reception is mixed, some say Alsop didn’t need to apologize because it happened a long time ago, while others are not convinced that Alsop was truly sorry due to him being an actor.  </p>
