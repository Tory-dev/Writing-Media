      <p>Clickmates is a parody website that touches on how websites use clickbait techniques such as putting something in the title of the article, twisting quotes around, and creating thumbnails that will make the users click. All people, shows are a work of fiction.</p>

      <div class="subtitle">
        <h1>Reflective Introduction: </h1>
      </div>

      <p>Honestly, this was a fun project to work on. Having worked in HTML and CSS a long time ago, brushing up on it, and learning new things like grids or exploring the class system was quite an experience. At the beginning of the page, this is how websites use misinformation to lure people to click on their page either with the title, quotes, or the thumbnail. Users who canâ€™t see this can get the wrong idea and can misunderstand other users. So, it is important to always tell truth and get your facts straight before you report anything.</p>
